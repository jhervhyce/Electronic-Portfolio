    <h2>Classroom Experiences</h2>
        <p> During my freshman year, I took on hands-on tech projects like breaking down and rebuilding a medium ATX computer, completing a science project, and participating in Intro to Computer Science. These experiences sparked my interest in technology and laid a strong foundation for my future learning. <br><br> In sophomore year, I expanded my skills by making an RJ45 network cable and completing the Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad) course, which gave me a solid understanding of networking basics. <br><br> Currently, as a junior, I am progressing through Cybersecurity 2 and Foundations of Business & Marketing. I have completed my electronic portfolio, developed coding projects including games and a digital clock, learned to use Git Bash, and am close to mastering Excel. I have also created multiple business and marketing presentations using Canva and Google Slides, and recently developed and presented a full business plan. I have started working on my senior portfolio and completed a project-based learning (PBL) essay assignment that challenged me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. </p>
